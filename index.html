        <p>
          Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in the
          United States, Canada, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Liberia. It began as
          a day of giving thanks for the blessing of the harvest and of the
          preceding year. Similarly named festival holidays occur in Germany and
          Japan. Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday of October in
          Canada and on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States and
          around the same part of the year in other places. Although
          Thanksgiving has historical roots in religious and cultural
          traditions, it has long been celebrated as a secular holiday as well.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p id="history">
          Prayers of thanks and special thanksgiving ceremonies are common among
          most religions after harvests and at other times.[1] The Thanksgiving
          holiday's history in North America is rooted in English traditions
          dating from the Protestant Reformation. It also has aspects of a
          harvest festival, even though the harvest in New England occurs well
          before the late-November date on which the modern Thanksgiving holiday
          is celebrated.[1][2] In the English tradition, days of thanksgiving
          and special thanksgiving religious services became important during
          the English Reformation in the reign of Henry VIII.[3] Before 1536
          there were 95 Church holidays, plus 52 Sundays, when people were
          required to attend church and forego work. Though the 1536 reforms in
          the Church of England reduced the number of holidays in the liturgical
          calendar to 27, the Puritan party in the Anglican Church wished to
          eliminate all Church holidays apart from the weekly Lord's Day,
          including the evangelical feasts of Christmas and Easter (cf. Puritan
          Sabbatarianism).[3] The holidays were to be replaced by specially
          called Days of Fasting and Days of Thanksgiving, in response to events
          that the Puritans viewed as acts of special providence. Unexpected
          disasters or threats of judgement from on high called for Days of
          Fasting.[4][3] Special blessings, viewed as coming from God, called
          for Days of Thanksgiving, which were observed through Christian church
          services and other gatherings.[3] For example, Days of thanksgiving
          were called following the victory over the Spanish Armada in 1588 and
          following the deliverance of Queen Anne in 1605.[4] An unusual annual
          Day of Thanksgiving began in 1606 following the failure of the
          Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and developed into Guy Fawkes Day on November
          5.[4] Days of Fasting were called on account of plagues in 1604 and
          1622, drought in 1611, and floods in 1613. Annual Thanksgiving prayers
          were dictated by the charter of English settlers upon their safe
          landing in America in 1619 at Berkeley Hundred in Virginia.[5]
